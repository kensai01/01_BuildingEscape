## Description

This is a buidling escape puzzle game where the goal is to escape each room by solving the puzzle therein. This games prototype was created by following
the class by Ben Tristem at Udemy called Unreal Engine Developer Course. My goal is to build upon this framework with additional content to 
make a more fun and complete game while at the same time gain valuable experience using Unreal Engine 4. 

`TODO Create a more in depth description of the game. `

## Setup

### Setup Requirements

In order to run this program you must have at least Unreal Engine 4 installed. Please note the code was written using Visual Studio 2015 so I'm not certain if there are any compatibility issues with Visual Studio 2013. 

`TODO Create a more detailed Setup Guide`

### Beginning with Testing Grounds

Clone or download the repository and run the BattleTanks.uproject file to have Unreal Engine create a project for you.
